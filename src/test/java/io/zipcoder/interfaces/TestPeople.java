//        Part 6.0 - Test People
//        Create a TestPeople class.
//        Create a testAdd method which ensures that our personList in our People class populated with respective Person objects following invokation of the add method.
//        Create a testRemove method which ensures that the personList in a People object is depopulated with a respective Person object following the invokation of the remove method.
//        Create a testFindById method which ensures that a respective Person object with a respective id field is returned upon invokation of the findById method on a respective People object.
//        Part 7.1 - Create Students singleton
//        Note: The creation of this class will demonstrate an implementation of singleton design pattern.
//        Create a Students class.
//        The class should be an unextendable subclass of the People class.
//        The class should statically instantiate a final field named INSTANCE of type Students.
//        The class should define a private nullary constructor which populates the INSTANCE field with respective Student representations of your colleagues.
//        Each student should have a relatively unique id field.
//        The class should define a getInstance method which returns the INSTANCE field.
