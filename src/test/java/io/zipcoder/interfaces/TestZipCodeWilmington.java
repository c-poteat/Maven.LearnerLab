//        Part 9.0 - Test ZipCodeWilmington
//        Create a TestZipCodeWilmington class.
//        Create a testHostLecture method which ensures that each of the Student's totalStudyTime instance variable is incremented by the specified numberOfHours upon invoking the hostLecture method.
//        Notice the Design Flaw - Odd Casting Issues
//        You may have noticed that the findById, and hostLecture methods require an intermediate casting trick.
//        To remedy this issue, we can generify the People class.
